                • The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet out from the Sun.<br>
                 It is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. <br><br><br>
               </div>
              
               <div style="color:purple;font-size: 29px;">
               • It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant”.<br>
               When Galileo discovered the four moons of Jupiter in 1610 this was the first proof of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth. <br><br><br>

               <div style="color:dodgerblue;font-size: 29px;">
                • The first recorded sighting of Jupiter were by the ancient Babylonians in around 7th or 8th BC.<br>
                 Jupiter has the shortest day of the eight planets. <br><br><br>

               <div style="color:cyan;font-size: 29px;">
                 • Jupiter is 778,340,821 km or 483,638,564 miles away from Sun,<br>
                  which is 5 times more from the Earth is from the Sun. <br><br><br>

                 • Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. To the Greeks, it represented Zeus, the god of thunder.<br>
                    The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon.   <br><Br><br>

               <div style="color:yellow;font-size: 29px;">
                 • It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes.<br>
                  The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape. <br><br><br>
               </div>
              
               <div style="color:orange;font-size: 29px;">
                 • Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years.<br>
                 From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking months to move from one constellation to another. <br><br><br>

               • The Great Red Spot is a huge storm on Jupiter.<br>
               It has raged for at least 350 years. It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it. <br><br><br>
